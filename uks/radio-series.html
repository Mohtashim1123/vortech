		   <p>A  radio  series  on  importanceof  registration  of  children  at  birth.It  is  the  fundamental  right  of  a  child  to  get  aregistrationcertificate  from  the  place  of  origin.The  denial  of  this  right  to  legal  recognition,  feeds  into  a  vicious  cycle  of  rejection  and  exclusion  of  a  child  from  other  guaranteed  rights,  protections  and  benefits.  The  absence  of  a  birth  certificate,  in  several  cases,  means  the  denial  of  an  education  and  inaccessibility  to  free  healthcare,  which  then  come  to  have  a  direct  bearing  on  a  child’s  future  economic  prospects  and  the  quality  of  his  life.  Without  proof  of  age,  a  child  may  be  denied  the  minimum  protections  provided  under  our  law  against  child  labour  and,  as  seen  in  several  cases,  against  child  marriages.Non-registration  of  births  is  a  problem  of  lack  of  awareness  and  also  accessibility  which  this  radio  series  hopes  to  address</p>
