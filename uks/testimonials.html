Apart  from  that,  Uks  started  a  mission,  where  journalists  would  be  trained,  as  to  how  one  should  project  gender  issues  and  a  drive  to  recuperate  them.  Uks  also  made  a  Code  of  Ethics  for  media.

Women  everywhere  have  the  right  to  tell  their  own  stories  and  share  their  perspectives.    In  Pakistan,  women  are  courageously  and  often,  quietly,  asserting  their  desire  to  play  an  increasingly  important  role  in  society.    The  rules  of  quality  journalism  befit  that  desire.    By  providing  accurate  accounts  of  events,  by  holding  those  in  power  accountable  and  giving  voice  to  the  countless  voiceless  in  their  country,  female  reporters  and  writers  are  a  precious  asset  that  we  should  all  support.

The  way  Tasneem  invited  journalists  like  myself  and  told  them,  when  writing  a  report  on  women,  how  they  should  be  mentioned,  what  their  issues  are.  The  way  she  sensitised  them  is  unparalleled  in  the  Pakistani  Media.  Now  the  change  we  see  on  the  media,  specifically  electronic  media,  on  women's  issues,  we  see  a  huge  role  of  Tasneem  and  her  team.  I  congratulate  Uks  and  myself  because  I  too  am  a  part  of  Uks  and  I  wish  they  can  keep  this  work  going.”</p>

Under  Tasneem's  leadership,  Uks  broke  the  silence  on  the  role  of  portrayal  of  women  in  the  media  and  create  a  whole  new  narrative  on  how  women  are  viewed  through  the  lens.  The  sensational  headlines,  the  blatant  angling  of  stories  and  putting  the  awareness  of  crime  on  women  were  some  of  the  initial  subjects  Uks  tackled.  Through  consistent  and  in-depth  research  Uks  made  media  houses  realise  how  demeaning  language  was  used  when  talking  about  stories  of  women.  Uks  took  stories  out  of  news  room,  into  the  editors͛  office,  into  the  news  room,  and  into  the  reporters͛  room,  by  taking  them  all  on  board  
                                        and  changing  how  women  were  portrayed  by  and  in  the  media.  It  created  space  for  women  in  these  roles,  making  them  more  confident  and  pro-active  as  journalists.  Since  then  Uks  has  continued  to  move  forward  from  one  medium  to  another,  it  has  widened  the  scope  from  print  media  to  radio,  research  and  more.”</p>

Tasneem  lent  a  vision  to  us  all  on  why  strategic  communications  was  critical  to  gender  and  development  initiatives.  We  have  lived  by  her  ABC's  of  communications  in  both  our  personal  lives  and  professional  lives.  A  for  Audience  research,  B  for  behaviour  change,  and  C  for  change  itself.  Uks  is  an  extension  of  Tasneem's  vision  for  mainstreaming  strategic  communications.  What  is  unique  is  Uks'  deep  commitment  to  ensuring  that  gender  rights  remain  at  the  heart  of  all  our  development  work.  We  are  very  pleased  that  she  continues  not  only  to  impact  on  development  initiatives  but  that  Uks  actually  even  develops  code  of  ethics,  it  influences  policy  makers,  it  influences  portrayals  of  men  and  women.  I  personally  think  their  work  on  radio  is  central  to  reaching  out  to  the  vulnerable,  to  the  women  and  finally  I  believe  that  Uks  is  unique  in  terms  of  its  consistent  focus  on  strategic  communications.”</p>

They  are  bringing  this  change  with  the  help  of  research,  training,  media  monitoring  and  production.  These  aspects  help  construct  a  better  medium.  Uks  is  trying  to  empower  women.  I  work  whole  heartedly  with  Uks.  How  fortunate  are  those  who  get  to  work  for  what  they  are  passionate  about  and  Uks  has  been  tirelessly  working  towards  this  goal  to  change  this  patriarchal  mind-set  through  media.”</p>
