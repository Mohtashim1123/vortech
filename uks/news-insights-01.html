			   <span>Karachi,  July  2018:</span>
			   <p>It  is  through  media  (in  this  case,  movies)  that  we  train  girls  and  women  to  have  low  expectations  and  train  boys  to  have  higher.  Sadly,most  of  our  movies  reinforce  the  images  of  girls/women  being  submissive  and  self-objectified,  whereas  boys/men  are  shown  as  the  dominant  and  totally  in-control  characters.  Unaware  of  the  biases,  most  moviegoers  do  not  go  to  theatres  thinking  about  gender  roles  and  or  how  its  representation  impacts  the  socio-cultural  fabric  of  a  community.  This  is  a  slow  but  deadly  way  of  influencing  their  mindsets  and  reinforcing  patriarchal,  misogynistic  and  chauvinistic  stereotypes.  The  representation  of  gender  in  these  films  shapes  imaginations  and  identity,  aspirations  and  ambition.  Needless  to  say  that  projecting  women  as  submissive  beings  or  sex  objects  (specially  the  item  numbers),  creates  more  hurdles  in  women’s  progress,  development,  empowerment  and  freedom  of  expression  and  mobility.  Women  are  then  believed  to  stayeither  behind  the  fourwalls  of  their  homes,  or  as  an‘entertainer’  in  a  club  or  any  similarsetting.  So  imagine,  women  and  girls  who  make  50  percent  (more  or  less)  of  the  population-globally,  who  are  infinitely  diverse  in  their  interests,  appearance,  ambition,  ability,  aspirations,  but  we  would  never  know  any  of  this  watching  our  top  rated  films.  Really,  how  can  we  continue  with  this  unreal  and  destructive  story-telling  and  for  how  long?  This  is  an  issue  and  needs  to  be  taken  up  on  a  priority  basis.  Though  in  Pakistan  we  haven’t  seen  many  women-centric  movies  with  clear-cut  progressive  narrative,  there  is,  however  one  movie  that  needs  not  only  to  be  recognized  but  also  to  be  applauded  which  is  “Motorcycle  Girl”.  Refreshing,  bold,  realistic  and  full  of  strong  messages,  the  movie  must  be  seen  by  all-girls/women,  boys,  men,  of  all  classes  and  ages.  The  movie  should,  in  fact,  be  made  part  of  media-cinema  curriculum.  Motorcycle  Girl  has  brought  to  life  in  full  strength  the  fact  that  women  are  neither  the  fairer  nor  the  weaker  sex.  They  are  equal,  in  all  ways.</p>
			   <p>It  is  in  this  regard  that  Uks  held  a  second  panel  discussion  in  theseries  ‘Dialogue  for  Change”with  the  cast  and  crew  of  this  amazing  movie.Directorand  writer,  Adnan  Sarwar,    Sohai  Ali  Abro  who  played  the  lead  role  and  senior  actor  Shamim  Hilali  were  present.According  to  Sarwar,  the  project  was  a  difficult  one  to  sell  to  financers  as  most  would  claim  that  audiences  would  not  be  able  to  accept  the  absence  of  a  male  lead  character,  and  thus  the  movie  would  not  be  a  commercial  success.He  explained  that  though  the  onus  to  transform  society  is  not  just  on  the  media,  he  hopes  that  his  film  can  make  a  small  contribution  towards  a  more  progressive  society.</p>
			   <p>Sohai  lamented  that  scripts  similar  to  Motorcycle  Girl  were  not  being  written  in  the  industry.“When  I  first  read  the  script,  I  was  surprised  that  a  man  had  written  it  as  it  was  very  sensitively  written  and  took  into  consideration  very  small  details  about  the  life  of  a  woman”.</p>
			  <p>Shamim  Hilali  recalled  the  good  old  days  of  Pakistani  television  which  were  not  driven  by  the  ratings  game  and  so  gave  way  to  some  brilliant  productions.</p>
		  <p>Audiences,  she  said,  have  also  contributed  to  the  influx  of  scripts  that  are  notwomen-centric.She  elaborated  how  there  is  a  need  to  address  what  is  being  communicated  and  taught  in  schools  to  young  
				boys  and  girls  which  is  promoting  a  certain  set  of  values  and  enforcing  gender  roles  that  are  not  progressive  and  are  in  fact  regressive</p>	
	  <p>The  aim  of  Uks  by  holding  such  dialogues  is  to  turn  passive  viewers  and  audiences  into  proactive  ones,  and  ascertain  the  extent  to  which  news  and  entertainment  content  can  influence  viewers,  both  male  and  female.</p>

			   <span>Karachi,  May  2018: </span>
			   <p>The  first  panel  discussion  featured  the  team  of  the  recently  concluded  Hum  TV  drama  serial  “Dar  Se  Jati  Hai  Sila”which  centred  round  the  story  of  Sila  who  is  sexually  abused  by  afamily  member,Joee  Mama.  It  was  held  under  the  initiativetitled,  “Dialogue  for  Change”. </p>
			   <p>Tasneem  Ahmar,  Director  Uks,  welcomed  the  participants,  introduced  Uks  to  audience  and  panellists,  and  gave  an  overview  of  Uks  past  activities.Tasneem  Ahmar,  said,“Non-stereotypical  media  is  a  vital  element.  In  quality  media  content  and  diverse  gender  portrayal  will  result  in  more  interesting  and  realistic  media  content  for  audiences.</p>
			   <p>She  disapproved  of  the  stereotyped  portrayal  of  women  where  daughters  were  portrayed  as  a  burden  and  women  were  held  to  be  synonymous  with  the  ‘honour’  of  the  family.  She  was  of  the  view  that  these  stereotypes  could  be  negative,  limiting  and  degrading.  All  this  needed  to  be  changed.</p>
			  <p>Talking  about  the  role  of  her  organization,  she  saidthat  its  gender-just  media  drive  over  the  last  two  years  (2015-2017)  took  up  many  challenges,  from  engaging  the  media  on  the  voluntary  adoption  of  Uks’  gender-sensitive  code  of  ethics,  to  generating  wider  public  interest  in  Uks  Women’s  Media  Complaint  Cell.</p>
		  <p>Ms.  Ahmar  requested  the  panelists  to  talk  about  their  experience  shooting  the  drama  on  a  topic  considered  taboo  in  a  Pakistani  society.  Bee  Gul,  writer  of  the  play,  sharing  her  experiences  said  that  she  was  told  that  her  writing  was  too  bold  for  Pakistani  society.  She  said  her  writings  often  addressed  topics  considered  taboo,  and  many  a  times  her  projects  almost  got  her  killed!  Speaking  about  the  choice  of  a  middle  class  family  structure  for  the  drama  she  said  it  was  important  to  speak  about  the  fact  that  abuse  happens  in  most  ordinary  of  the  settings  too  and  it  has  not  spared  a  middle  class  joint  family  system  either.  She  said  she  wanted  to  break  the  myth  that  the  abuse  often  happens  in  apparent  elite  and  liberal  families.  She  considered  herself  lucky  that  her  play  script  went  to  Kashif  Nisar,  director,  who  had  the  required  sensibility  and  sensitivity  expected  for  this  topic.  She  believes  the  issue  is  so  very  common  in  the  society  that  she  is  surprised  that  people  are  not  already  addressing  it.</p>	
	  <p>She  said  that  the  Dialogue  for  Change  initiative  consisted  in  turning  passive  viewers  and  audiences  into  active  and  proactive  ones,  and  to  determineas  to  what  extent  news  and  entertainment  content  influenced  viewers.</p>	
	<p>The  writer  of  the  serial,  Bee  Gul,  said  that  the  concept  that  formed  an  important  part  of  our  TV  plays  of  a  poor  girl  or  a  very  young  girl  being  submissive  would  have  to  be  revisited,  because  she  thought  that  was  not  quite  in  line  with  reality.Speaking  about  reactions  to  her  writing  she  said  that  people  liked  the  story  but  said  it  was  “bold”.  Therefore  there  was  a  lot  of  hesitance  in  sending  the  story  for  production.  She  shared  that  a  lot  of  people  after  this  drama  came  up  to  her  to  share  their  stories  of  harassment  and  how  relatable  the  story  was.  Ms.  Gul  said  that  we  usually  warn  children  against  strangers  often  forgetting  that  majority  of  the  predators  are  close  family  members.</p> 
<p>Veteran  TV  star  Sakina  Samo  (character  Bari  Apa)  was  of  the  view  that  one  had  to  go  down  to  the  level  of  the  character  being  portrayed.While  sharing  experiences  from  the  set  she  said  that  improvisation  also  made  its  way  into  the  dialogues.  She  shared  experiences  where  actors  brought  into  their  own  creative  ideas  to  bypass  conservative  laws  of  censorship  imposed  upon  them.</p>	
<p>Ms.  Ahmar  asked  Kashif  Nisar  how  hard  he  found  the  direction  of  the  drama  written  on  child  sexual  abuse  and  if  he  faced  any  resistance.  Mr  Nisar  shared  that  the  challenge  for  him  was  how  to  speak  about  child  sexual  abuse  in  such  a  ‘closed’  society.  Ms.  Ahmar  said  and  Mr  Nisar  agreed  that  the  picture  we  often  portray  of  a  rapist  or  predator  is  far  from  reality  whereas  predators  are  common  people  among  us.  Mr.  Nisar  said  that  the  script  was  very  intelligent  and  not  only  socio-cultural  but  even  economic  aspect  was  very  cleverly  highlighted.</p>
<p>Ms.  Gul  said  that  Mr.  Nisar  faced  the  challenge  of  putting  the  “bold”  story  on  screen  and  that  too  with  a  message  that  the  story  was  nothing  spicy  that  we  wished  to  ‘capitalise  on’,  but  a  serious  sensitive  topic.Nisar  shared  that  they  received  a  notice  from  PEMRA  (Pakistan  Electronic  Media  Regulatory  Authority)  immediately  after  the  second  episode  was  aired.  He  said  that  it  took  time  for  the  audience  to  digest  content  of  the  drama  and  accept  it!</p>
<p>Ms.  Gul  added  that  they  received  three  notices  from  PEMRA  in  total.  One  complainant,  a  woman,  said  she  was  feeling  uncomfortable  with  the  content  of  the  drama.  She  said  that  in  her  response  she  wrote  that  the  drama  was  made  exactly  to  make  people  uncomfortable!  PEMRA’s  ceased  issuing  notices  to  them  through  after  the  tragic  child  sexual  abuse  incident  in  Kasur.Mr.  Nisar  shared  that  even  their  own  families  became  uncomfortable  and  that  his  mother  asked  him  why  he  had  taken  up  this  project.</p>
<p>Ms  Gul  also  shared  that  Mr.  Nisar  had  made  his  9  and  11-year-old  daughters  watch  this  drama.  Mr.  Nisar  agreed  and  said  it  was  the  right  age  where  children  should  be  made  aware  about  such  topics.Noman  Ejaz  (character  Joee  Mama)  shared  that  he  was  reluctant  initially  and  had  refused  the  role.  He  said  he  wasn't  sure  if  the  creators  of  the  drama  were  as  sensitive  towards  the  issue  as  required.  When  Mr.  Nisar  got  the  script  he  made  him  sit  and  discuss  the  character  once  again.  That  is  when  Mr  Ejaz  said  he  accepted  the  role.  He  believes  that  the  topic  was  handled  very  carefully  and  sensitively  and  it  was  very  well  done.</p>
<p>Yumna  Zaidi  (character  Sila)  said  that  a  lot  of  girls  reached  out  to  her  after  the  drama  and  that  made  her  realise  survivors  found  strength  in  Sila’s  character.  Saman  Ansari  (character  Saadia)  shared  that  people  came  up  to  her  to  express  how  much  they  could  relate  to  script  because  it  hit  so  close  to  home.</p>
<p>Ms.  Gul  shared  that  it  was  surprising  for  them  that  their  drama  got  ratings.  She  said  the  ratings  further  broke  the  myth  that  audience  do  not  like  to  watch  dramas  on  sensitive  topics  and  that  was  a  big  success.  
		Advertisers  role  was  also  discussed  following  which  Mr.  Nisar  said  that  advertisers  practically  control  your  content  and  it  is  a  big  issue  creative  industry  is  currently  facing.  Nisar  further  added  that  they  did  not  expect  the  drama  to  do  really  well  and  negotiated  with  the  channel  to  give  drama  the  space  reserved  for  low-rated  dramas!</p>
<p>Ms.  Gul  further  shared  how  she  has  often  victimized  throughout  her  career  for  her  “bold”  content.  She  said  she  was  surprised  that  such  criticism  also  comes  from  women-owned  channels. </p>
<p>Regarding  location  of  the  set  Ms.  Gul  sugared  that  the  intention  of  filming  in  one  location  was  to  convey  ‘suffocation’  that  a  survivor  felt.</p>
<p>During  the  open-discussion  a  clinical  psychologist,  Asha  Bedar,  shared  that  a  lot  of  myths  were  shattered  with  this  drama.  It  also  shattered  the  notion  that  parents  are  always  right.  She  shares  that  trauma  in  dramas  is  generally  shown  as  something  sensational,  but  this  drama  showed  it  realistically.She  adds  that  typically  powerful  women  in  dramas  are  often  shown  pulling  each  other  down  but  in  this  play  while  women  were  fighting  they  were  also  supportive  of  each  other  at  other  times,  which  is  the  real  picture  of  the  society.</p>
<p>At  the  end  of  the  discussion  Moderator  Tasneem  Ahmar  extended  her  gratitude  to  the  participants  of  the  panel  discussion  and  expressed  satisfaction  with  the  results  of  the  discussion.</p>
