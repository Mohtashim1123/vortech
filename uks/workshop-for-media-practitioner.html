								<p>The two-day media workshop was organized by Uks Research Centre as part of the project Energy for People. To further its role as a change-maker, Uks Research Centre, initiated this project to impart a better understanding of energy issues confronting Pakistan, and develop a cadre of specialist journalist producing quality content.
									</p>
									<p>This workshop was held in collaboration with Shell Pakistan, the need for which was reinforced after content monitoring and analysis carried out by the Uks team. This analysis illustrated that media coverage of energy issues often lacks understanding of the current situation, and is mostly focused on events rather than issues. </p>
									<p>Despite the fact that Pakistan is faced with an acute energy crisis, the very vibrant media is not able to bring out issues and make the connection between energy and economic growth as well as the accoutrements that go with comfortable living. Only when the media starts to look at energy issues beyond the paradigm of political blame-games and point scoring on who failed and why, will it can start to focus on the fact that Pakistan has access to multiple sources of energy and needs to plan for a sustainable energy future </p>
									<p>The media can actually highlight the existing potentials to explore these forms of energy, and create awareness among people with care and sensitivity - to enable them to understand the most important issues in the energy sector and should report/produce content that would benefit the public by raising their level of awareness of how to handle this energy crisis, advocate for long-term positive change and the political will to do so. </p>

																					<p>The two-day media workshop was organized by Uks Research Centre as part of the project Energy for People.

																						<p>This workshop was held in collaboration with Shell Pakistan, the need for which was reinforced after content monitoring and analysis carried out by the Uks team. This analysis illustrated that media coverage of energy issues often lacks understanding of the current situation, and is mostly focused on events rather than issues. </p>
																						<p>Despite the fact that Pakistan is faced with an acute energy crisis, the very vibrant media is not able to bring out issues and make the connection between energy and economic growth as well as the accoutrements that go with comfortable living. Only when the media starts to look at energy issues beyond the paradigm of political blame-games and point scoring on who failed and why, will it can start to focus on the fact that Pakistan has access to multiple sources of energy and needs to plan for a sustainable energy future </p>
																						<p>The media can actually highlight the existing potentials to explore these forms of energy, and create awareness among people with care and sensitivity - to enable them to understand the most important issues in the energy sector and should report/produce content that would benefit the public by raising their level of awareness of how to handle this energy crisis, advocate for long-term positive change and the political will to do so. </p>
