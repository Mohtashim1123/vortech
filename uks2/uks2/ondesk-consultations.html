											<p> This was the first panel discussion in the series of DfC, featuring the team of the then recently
												concluded Hum TV drama serial “Dar Si Jati Hai Sila” which centered round the story of Sila who is sexually
												abused by a family member, Joee Mama. Dialogue for Change initiative aims to turn passive viewers and
												audiences into active and proactive ones, and to determine as to what extent news and entertainment content
												influences the viewers.
												Ms. Ahmar requested the panellists to talk about their experience of shooting the drama on a topic
												considered taboo in a Pakistani society. Bee Gul, writer of the play, shared that she was told that her
												writing was too bold for Pakistani society. She said her writings often addressed topics considered taboo,
												and many a times her projects almost got her killed! Yumna Zaidi (character Sila) said that a lot of girls
												reached out to her after the drama and that made her realise survivors found strength in Sila’s character.
												Saman Ansari (character Saadia) shared that people came up to her to express how much they could relate to
												script because it hit so close to home. Gul also shared that it was surprising for them that their drama
												got such high ratings. She said the ratings further broke the myth that audience do not like to watch
												dramas on sensitive topics and that was a big success.

											<p> Though in Pakistan we haven’t seen many women-centric movies with a clear-cut progressive narrative,
												there is, however one movie that needs not only to be recognized but also applauded; “Motorcycle Girl”.
												It is in this regard that Uks held a second panel discussion in the series ‘Dialogue for Change” with the
												cast and crew of this amazing movie.
												Director and writer, Adnan Sarwar, Sohai Ali Abro who played the lead role and senior actor Shamim Hilali
												were present. According to Sarwar, the project was a difficult one to sell to financers as most claimed
												that audiences would not be able to accept the absence of a male lead character, and the movie would not be
												a commercial success. Sohai lamented that scripts similar to Motorcycle Girl were not being written in the
												industry. She said “When I first read the script, I was surprised that a man had written it as it was very
												sensitively written and took into consideration very small details about the life of a woman”. Shamim
												Hilali recalled the good old days of Pakistani television which were not driven by the ratings game so gave
												some brilliant productions.
												The aim of Uks in holding such dialogues is to turn passive viewers and audiences into proactive ones, and
												ascertain the extent to which news and entertainment content can influence viewers, both male and female.
												Some very interesting comments came from the very engaged audience.

												violence, Uks’ team shared media clippings of content produced by the media house which violated
												gender-sensitivity ethics. The team also questioned them on their policies for work place harassment, safe
												working environment for women and better workplace infrastructure e.g. separate washrooms etc. and equal
												salary and promotion policies for female employees. The representatives assured them that they would try
												their level best to provide women with better facilities but due to budget constraints and uncooperative
												staff members, circumstances in media houses are not ideal and require a lot of improvement.

											<p> Tasneem Ahmar, Executive Director, Uks Research Centre launched the publication ‘Uks Kahani’ and shared
												her story of 20 years of passion and commitment from the founding of Uks till its 20th Anniversary. The
												panel discussion on Feminizing News and Views in Pakistani was moderated by Farieha Aziz. Senior journalist
												Zubeida Mustafa said that there was a need for more female journalists. ‘Money makes the world go round.
												The owners always have an upper hand and they think in terms of commercialisation first because they are
												running businesses,’ she said. Kamal Siddiqui, Director of the Centre of Excellence in Journalism at the
												Institute of Business Administration shared that editors gave women reporters soft beats as they think they
												don`t have the means or attitude for hard news. Uzma Alkarim, Head of the Gender Sensitivity Committee at
												Geo TV, said she had known people who believed that women don`t step out of their homes to build careers,
												but only if they had financial needs to cater to. Film-maker and actor Meher Jafri said what society
												reflected was also filtered down in content. `Our plays and movies show tragedies with weak and victimised
												women,’ she said. ‘But this is also what the viewers like to watch so the sponsors also support such plays
												and movies.’

											<p> In the opening keynote address, Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Sherry Rehman stated that
												journalism and democracy were very strongly connected. Women 30 years ago had fewer roles as models and
												mentors and had to claim their spaces. She added that 79 percent of women in media content are portrayed as
												victims even now and the situation is not satisfactory as according to press clubs, women make up only
												small percentage of the total number of journalists in Pakistan. The first was a panel discussion on
												`Feminizing News and Views in Pakistani Media`, which featured journalists from various media houses.
												Artist and activist Sheema Kermani began the second session with a discussion on art as activism. She noted
												that dance is often considered the lowest category of art in society. During the discussion, Dawn CEO
												Hameed Haroon said the Pakistan media was not a domain where women were employed before 1979. He spoke
												about how Dawn became an equal opportunity employer, giving preference to women that increased the number
												of women working there from one to 40 within a year. Former NCSW Chairperson Khawar Mumtaz said women
												journalists had played a great role in womens’ rights movements, while renowned poet Kishwar Naheed spoke
												about the media scenario for women in the 50s and 60s, and the various trends of how women are portrayed in
												the print media. Ms Naheed also recited poems including Hum Gunahgaar Aurtain and Jootay bechti, mozay
												bechti aurat mera naam nahi`.

											<p>Uks organised panel discussions in Islamabad and Karachi to commemorate the International Day of
												Democracy and 70 years of Pakistan. Speakers for the Islamabad panel discussion included Senator Sherry
												Rehman, Chairperson, National Commission on the Status of Women, Ms Khawar Mumtaz and Senior Anchorperson
												on Current Affairs Ms Asma Shirazi. Setting the stage for the panel discussion, a digital story “Women of
												Pakistan: the Past and Present” was screened [Watch Here]. Produced by Nabeela Aslam for Uks Research
												Centre, the digital story paid tribute to the resilient and courageous women who fought against feudal
												bureaucracy and military dictatorships. Leading movements and raising their voices against the violation of
												citizen’s rights these women fought parallel battles with misogyny and patriarchal mind-sets.
												The event in Karachi also began with the screening of the digital story followed by a panel discussion.
												Karachi panelists were human and women rights activist and journalist Ms. Hilda Saeed, Digital rights
												defender and journalist Ms. Fareiha Aziz and human rights lawyer Ms. Maleeha Zia Lari. Each one of them
												shared their own take on whether women of Pakistan had progressed or regressed in the last 70 years. It was
												interesting to listen to the personal and professional experiences of the panelists on the role and status

									It was discussed how women could be better portrayed and represented through and in media. The need to increase awareness among journalists and readers/ audience and to build their capacity to understand and differentiate between balanced, gender-just reporting and biased and gender insensitive reporting was highlighted. Specifically the need for sensitization of male journalists was focused. Journalists and media managers must work to bridge the responsibility gap

												workshops were attended by media persons including editors, bureau chiefs, reporters, desk persons, and
												staff and in Quetta, by students of the Mass Communication Department of Baluchistan University. The
												workshops results were compiled in the publication "Changing Images”
												Each workshop began with an introduction by Ms. Ahmar, Director Uks, and was followed by a discussion about
												the portrayal of women in the English and Urdu language presses. Participants then explored either the Urdu
												or the English medium press, in small groups. Issues pertaining to the national and regional press were
												also discussed.
												The debates and the discussions were based on the following questions:
